            Penetration Testing Kit is a cross-browser extension designed to support users in their
            day-to-day application security job.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because PTK is a cross-browser extension instead of a standalone tool, it is the fastest and most
            efficient
            way to test web applications for security vulnerabilities. It makes it simple to get detailed
            information
            about an app and to execute modified HTTP requests without javascript validation, sequence recording
            with
            HAR file output.PTK handles authentication with normal user sessions—all users have to do is install
            the
            extension and start their tests.

            ​</p>
        <p>

            PTK helps penetration testers, Red/Blue/Purple Teams, and application security practitioners
            test web
            applications for security vulnerabilities.

        </p>
        <p>

            Because it is so easy to install and use, it is also ideal for developers to either
            quickly test their code,
            or replicate previously-identified vulnerabilities.
